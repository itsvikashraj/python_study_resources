Data Analytics Projects
Welcome to my collection of Data Analytics projects! This repository showcases various projects where we explore datasets from different sources. Below, youâ€™ll find a step-by-step breakdown of our approach:

Project Workflow
1 Loading the Dataset 

. We begin by loading datasets obtained from various sources. Each dataset is carefully selected to demonstrate different aspects of data analysis.

2 Data Cleaning

Cleaning the data is a crucial step. This involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
Data Sorting and Transformation

After cleaning, we sort and transform the data using various methods to prepare it for analysis. This may include filtering, grouping, and aggregating data to derive meaningful insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Finally, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. This step involves visualizing data and using statistical methods to extract valuable insights.
